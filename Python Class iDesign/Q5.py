# Write a Python code to check duplicate user details. There can be only one user with a specific mobile number.
# If two users exist with the same mobile number they are duplicate. Check whether user information is the same or not by overriding
# the equals method.
# Create a User class with the following attributes 
# Attributes
# Datatype
# name str
# username str
# password str
# mobile_number int
# Use __init__() constructor to initialize the variables with respect to class.
# Override __eq__() method that compares mobile_number of the two objects.
# Input format :
# Input consists of 2 userâ€™s details, which contains (name, username, password, mobile_number).
# Output format :
# The output is a string value, denoting whether the users were same or not by comparing the mobile number of the user.
# [All Texts in bold corresponds to the input and rest are output] 
# Sample Input and Output - 1:
# Enter the details of User 1
# Name :
# Meena
# Username :
# Meena2020
# Password :
# Basic
# Mobile Number :
# 1234567890
# Enter the details of User 2
# Name :
# Meena
# Username :
# Meena1010
# Password :
# Probob
# Mobile Number :
# 0987654321
# User 1 and User 2 are not equal

# Sample Input and Output - 2:
