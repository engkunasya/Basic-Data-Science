# In this problem, given two feature vectors as input , find the Chebyshev distance between the given vectors
# without using any inbuild python libraries.
# Input format :
# 1st line of input is an integer ‘n’, which corresponds to the length of both the vectors
# Next 2 lines of input consists of ‘n’ space separated integers, which corresponds to the 1st and 2nd input vectors .
# Output Format :
# Output corresponds to single integer value, which corresponds to the Chebyshev Distance between the vectors.
# Note : print ‘Invalid Input’ , if the vectors length doesn’t match.
# Sample Input :
# Enter the length of the array
# 3
# 1 5 89
# 236 4 58
# Sample Output :
# 235
